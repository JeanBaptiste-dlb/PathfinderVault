+ Have ready a table of 6 interesting encounters with one dangerous encounter to roll from.
+ Multiple of those encounters can be the same type of enemies with variations.
+ All of the encounters must pose a potential threat and have a reason behind their hostility (not just a will to kill the characters). They must be doing something already when meeting the players.
+ They should be impactful
+ They should have the potential to impact the characters forever
+ They should be memorable and related to the setting.
+ You can derive an idea like you pull a thread until it becomes interesting e.g. 
	+ A robot in a cave
	+ A robot in a cave that digs for eternity
	+ A robot in a cave that digs for eternity on behalf of a mastermind trying to make a city collapse on itself
