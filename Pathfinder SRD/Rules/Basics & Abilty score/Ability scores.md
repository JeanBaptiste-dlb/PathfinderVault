Each character has six ability scores that represent his character’s most basic attributes. They are his raw talent and prowess. While a character rarely rolls a check using just an ability score, these scores, and the modifiers they create, affect nearly every aspect of a character’s skills and abilities. Each ability score generally ranges from 3 to 18, although racial bonuses and penalties can alter this; an average ability score is 10.

## Generating ability scores
There are a number of different methods used to generate ability scores. Each of these methods gives a different level of flexibility and randomness to character generation.

Table: Ability Score Costs
| Score | Points |
|:-----:|:------:|
|   7   |   -4   |
|   8   |   -2   |
|   9   |   -1   |
|   10  |    0   |
|   11  |    1   |
|   12  |    2   |
|   13  |    3   |
|   14  |    5   |
|   15  |    7   |
|   16  |   10   |
|   17  |   13   |
|   18  |   17   |

Racial modifiers (adjustments made to your ability scores due to your character’s race—see [[Races]] are applied after the scores are generated.

**Standard**: Roll 4d6, discard the lowest die result, and add the three remaining results together. Record this total and repeat the process until six numbers are generated. Assign these totals to your ability scores as you see fit. This method is less random than Classic and tends to create characters with above-average ability scores.

**Classic**: Roll 3d6 and add the dice together. Record this total and repeat the process until you generate six numbers. Assign these results to your ability scores as you see fit. This method is quite random, and some characters will have clearly superior abilities. This randomness can be taken one step further, with the totals applied to specific ability scores in the order they are rolled. Characters generated using this method are difficult to fit to predetermined concepts, as their scores might not support given classes or personalities, and instead are best designed around their ability scores.

**Heroic**: Roll 2d6 and add 6 to the sum of the dice. Record this total and repeat the process until six numbers are generated. Assign these totals to your ability scores as you see fit. This is less random than the Standard method and generates characters with mostly above-average scores.

**Dice Pool**: Each character has a pool of 24d6 to assign to his statistics. Before the dice are rolled, the player selects the number of dice to roll for each score, with a minimum of 3d6 for each ability. Once the dice have been assigned, the player rolls each group and totals the result of the three highest dice. For more high-powered games, the GM should increase the total number of dice to 28. This method generates characters of a similar power to the Standard method.

**Purchase**: Each character receives a number of points to spend on increasing his basic attributes. In this method, all attributes start at a base of 10. A character can increase an individual score by spending some of his points. Likewise, he can gain more points to spend on other scores by decreasing one or more of his [[Ability scores]]. No score can be reduced below 7 or raised above 18 using this method. See **Table: Ability Score Costs** for the costs of each score. After all the points are spent, apply any racial modifiers the character might have.

The number of points you have to spend using the purchase method depends on the type of campaign you are playing. The standard value for a character is 15 points. Average nonplayer characters (NPCs) are typically built using as few as 3 points. See **Table: Ability Score Points** for a number of possible point values depending on the style of campaign. The purchase method emphasizes player choice and creates equally balanced characters.

### Determine Bonuses (or Penalties)

Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier ranging from –5 to +5. **Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells** shows the modifier for each score. The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier with some numbers that aren’t die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty. The table also shows bonus spells, which you’ll need to know about if your character is a spellcaster.

## The Abilities

Each ability partially describes your character and affects some of his actions.

### Strength (Str)

See [Carrying Capacity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/carrying-capacity) for details on lifting and dragging.

Strength measures muscle and physical power. This ability is important for those who engage in hand-to-hand (or “melee”) combat, such as [[fighter]], [[monk]], [[paladin]], and some [[ranger]]. Strength also sets the maximum amount of weight your character can carry.

A character with a Strength score of 0 is too weak to move in any way and is [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious). Some creatures (such as [incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal) creatures) do not possess a Strength score and have no modifier at all to Strength-based skills or checks.

You apply your character’s Strength modifier to:

-   [Melee attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) rolls.
-   Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon, including a [sling](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/sling). (**Exceptions**: Off-hand attacks receive only half the character’s Strength bonus, while two-handed attacks receive 1–1/2 times the Strength bonus. A Strength penalty, but not a bonus, applies to attacks made with a bow that is not a composite bow.)
-   [Climb](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb) and [Swim](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim) checks.
-   Strength checks (for [breaking down doors](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Damaged-Objects) and the like).

Your Strength score determines your characters [carrying capacity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/exploration-movement#TOC-Carrying-Capacity).

**Temporary Bonuses**: Temporary increases to your Strength score give you a bonus on Strength-based skill checks, melee [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll), and weapon damage rolls (if they rely on Strength). The bonus also applies to your [Combat Maneuver Bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus) (if you are Small or larger) and to your [Combat Maneuver Defense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense).

**Permanent Bonuses**: Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points, [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points), and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

**Ability Damage**: Damage to your Strength score causes you to take penalties on Strength-based skill checks, melee [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll), and weapon damage rolls (if they rely on Strength). The Ability Damage penalty also applies to your [Combat Maneuver Bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus) (if you are Small or larger) and your [Combat Maneuver Defense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense). See Ability Score Damage below.

### Dexterity (Dex)

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is the most important one for [[rogue]], but it’s also useful for characters who wear light or medium armor or no armor at all. This ability is vital for characters seeking to excel with ranged weapons, such as the bow or [sling](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/sling). A character with a Dexterity score of 0 is incapable of moving and is effectively immobile (but not [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious)).

You apply your character’s Dexterity modifier to:

-   [Ranged attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#ranged-attacks) rolls, including those for attacks made with bows, crossbows, throwing axes, and many ranged spell attacks like [scorching ray](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/scorching-ray) or [searing light](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/searing-light).
-   [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) ([AC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class)), provided that the character can react to the attack.
-   [Reflex saving throws](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex), for avoiding [fireballs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fireball) and other attacks that you can escape by moving quickly.
-   [Acrobatics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics), [Disable Device](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device), [Escape Artist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist), [Fly](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly), [Ride](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride), [Sleight of Hand](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sleight-of-hand), and [Stealth](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth) checks.

**Temporary Bonuses**: Temporary increases to your Dexterity score give you a bonus on Dexterity-based skill checks, [Ranged attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#ranged-attacks) rolls, [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) checks, and [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) saving throws. The bonus also applies to your [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class), your [Combat Maneuver Bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus) (if you are Tiny or smaller), and your [Combat Maneuver Defense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense).

**Permanent Bonuses**: Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points, [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points), and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

**Ability Damage**: Damage to your Dexterity score causes you to take penalties on Dexterity-based skill checks, [ranged attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#ranged-attacks) rolls, [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) checks, and [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) saving throws. The Ability Damage penalty also applies to your [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class), your [Combat Maneuver Bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus) (if you are Tiny or smaller), and to your [Combat Maneuver Defense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense). See Ability Score Damage below.

### Constitution (Con)

Constitution represents your character’s health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character’s [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points), so the ability is important for all classes. Some creatures, such as [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) and [constructs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct), do not have a Constitution score. Their modifier is +0 for any Constitution-based checks. A character with a Constitution score of 0 is [dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead).

You apply your character’s Constitution modifier to:

-   Each roll of a [Hit Die](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-dice) (though a penalty can never drop a result below 1—that is, a character always gains at least 1 hit point each time he advances in level).
-   [Fortitude saving throws](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude), for resisting [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison), [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases), and similar threats.

If a character’s Constitution score changes enough to alter his or her Constitution modifier, the character’s [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points) also increase or decrease accordingly.

**Temporary Bonuses**: Temporary increases to your Constitution score give you a bonus on your [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) saving throws. In addition, multiply your total [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) by this bonus and add that amount to your current and total [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points). When the bonus ends, remove this total from your current and total [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points).

**Permanent Bonuses**: Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points, [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points), and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

**Ability Damage**: Damage to your Constitution score causes you to take penalties on your [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) saving throws. In addition, multiply your total [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) by the Ability Damage penalty and subtract that amount from your current and total [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points). Lost [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points) are restored when the damage to your Constitution is healed. See Ability Score Damage below.

#### Notes:

-   [Constructs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct) do not have a Constitution score. Any DCs or other Statistics that rely on a Constitution score treat a [construct](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct) as having a score of 10 (no bonus or penalty).
-   [Undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) creatures do not have a Constitution score. [Undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) use their [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) score in place of their Constitution score when calculating [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points), [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) saves, and any special ability that relies on Constitution(such as when calculating a [breath weapon’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-) DC).

### Intelligence (Int)

FAQ

**If I wear a _[headband of vast intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/headband-of-vast-intelligence)_, do I get retroactive skill ranks for my [Int](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) increase in addition to the skill ranks associated with the item?**

No. The skill associated with the magic item represents the “retroactive” skill ranks you’d get from the item increasing your Intelligence. You don’t get the item’s built-in skill ranks and another set to assign however you want.

[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9og7)]

#### Unoffical Paizo Board Post…

“All bonuses are retroactive when an ability score increases, be they bonuses to damage, to skill ranks, to [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points), to saves, to skill checks… all of them. Skill ranks not being retroactive are a 3.5 convention we specifically removed from the game because it was a weird exception to the rule, and since now there are no exceptions to this rule, there’s no need to specifically state that skill ranks are retroactively granted if your [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)|intelligence]] goes up.”

[[Source](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2kpru?Int-and-Skills#1)]

Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This ability is important for [[Wizard]] because it affects their spellcasting ability in many ways. Creatures of [animal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal)-level instinct have [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)|intelligence]] scores of 1 or 2. Any creature capable of understanding speech has a score of at least 3. A character with an [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)|intelligence]] score of 0 is comatose. Some creatures do not possess an [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)|intelligence]] score. Their modifier is +0 for any Intelligence-based skills or checks.

You apply your character’s [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)|intelligence]] modifier to:

-   The number of bonus [languages](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/linguistics) your character knows at the start of the game. These are in addition to any starting racial languages and Common. If you have a penalty, you can still read and speak your racial languages unless your [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)|intelligence]] is lower than 3.
-   The number of skill points gained each level, though your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level.
-   [Appraise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/appraise), [Craft](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft), [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge), [Linguistics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/linguistics), and [Spellcraft](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/spellcraft) checks.

A [[Wizard]] gains bonus spells based on his [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)| intelligence]] score. The minimum[[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)| intelligence]] score needed to cast a [[Wizard]] spell is 10 + the spell’s level.

**Temporary Bonuses**: Temporary increases to your [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)| intelligence]] score give you a bonus on Intelligence-based skill checks. This bonus also applies to any spell DCs based on Intelligence.

**Permanent Bonuses**: Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points, [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points), and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

**Ability Damage**: Damage to your [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)|intelligence]] score causes you to take penalties on Intelligence-based skill checks. The Ability Damage penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on Intelligence. See Ability Score Damage below.

#### Notes:

-   [Animals](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) have [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)| intelligence]] scores of 1 or 2 (no creature with an [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)| intelligence]] score of 3 or higher can be an [animal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal)).
-   Oozes do not have an [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)|intelligence]] score, and as such they have [immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to all [mind-affecting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting) effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). An [ooze](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze) with an [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)|intelligence]] score loses this trait.
-   Regular plants, such as one finds growing in gardens and fields, lack Intelligence, [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-), and [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) scores; even though plants are alive, they are objects, not creatures.
-   [Vermin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Vermin) do not have an [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)|intelligence]] score, and as such they have [immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to all [mind-affecting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting) effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms). Mindless creatures have no feats or skills. A [vermin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Vermin)-like creature with an [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)|intelligence]] score is usually either an [animal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) or a [magical beast](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast), depending on its other abilities.

### Wisdom (Wis)

Wisdom describes a character’s willpower, common sense, awareness, and intuition. Wisdom is the most important ability for [[Cleric|clerics]] and [[Druid|druids]], and it is also important for [[Monk|monks]] and [[Ranger|rangers]]. If you want your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score. A character with a Wisdom score of 0 is incapable of rational thought and is [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious).

You apply your character’s Wisdom modifier to:

-   [Will saving throws](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) (for negating the effects of [charm person](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-person) and other spells).
-   [Heal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal), [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception), [Profession](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession), [Sense Motive](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive), and [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival) checks.

[Clerics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric), [druids](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid), and [rangers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger) get bonus spells based on their Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom score needed to cast a [cleric](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric), [druid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid), or [ranger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger) spell is 10 + the spell’s level.

**Temporary Bonuses**: Temporary increases to your Wisdom score give you a bonus on Wisdom-based skill checks and [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) saving throws. This bonus also applies to any spell DCs based on Wisdom.

**Permanent Bonuses**: Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points, [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points), and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

**Ability Damage**: Damage to your Wisdom score causes you to take penalties on Wisdom-based skill checks and [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) saving throws. The Ability Damage penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on Wisdom. See Ability Score Damage below.

#### Notes:

-   Regular plants, such as one finds growing in gardens and fields, lack [[Ability scores#Intelligence (Int)|intelligence]], Wisdom, and [[Ability scores#Charisma (Cha)|charisma]] scores; even though plants are alive, they are objects, not creatures.

The following table gathered from various d20 sources by d20pfsrd.com editors. The Scores and Modifiers are “official” but examples and descriptions are determined by d20pfsrd.com editors. Consult your GM with any questions. Note also that the description texts are not intended to be “mechanical”- that is, they are merely for descriptive purposes.


 

### Charisma (Cha)

Charisma measures a character’s personality, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and appearance. It is the most important ability for [paladins](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin), [sorcerers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer), and [bards](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard). It is also important for [clerics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric), since it affects their ability to [channel energy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#TOC-Channel-Energy-Su-). For [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) creatures, [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha) is a measure of their unnatural “lifeforce.” Every creature has a [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha) score. A character with a [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha) score of 0 is not able to exert himself in any way and is [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious).

You apply your character’s [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha) modifier to:

-   [Bluff](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff), [Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy), [Disguise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise), [Handle Animal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal), [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate), [Perform](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform), and [Use Magic Device](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/use-magic-device) checks.
-   Checks that represent attempts to influence others.
-   [Channel energy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#TOC-Channel-Energy) DCs for [clerics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric) and [paladins](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin) attempting to harm [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) foes.

[Bards](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard), [paladins](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin), and [sorcerers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer) gain a number of bonus spells based on their [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha) scores. The minimum [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha) score needed to cast a [bard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard), [paladin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin), or [sorcerer](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer) spell is 10 + the spell’s level.

**Temporary Bonuses**: Temporary increases to your [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha) score give you a bonus on Charisma-based skill checks. This bonus also applies to any spell DCs based on Charisma.

**Permanent Bonuses**: Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points, [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points), and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

**Ability Damage**: Damage to your [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha) score causes you to take penalties on Charisma-based skill checks. The Ability Damage penalty also applies to any spell DCs based off [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha) and the DC to resist your channeled energy. See Ability Score Damage below.

## Ability Score Bonuses

Some spells and abilities increase your ability scores. Ability score increases with a duration of 1 day or less give only temporary bonuses. For every two points of increase to a single ability, apply a +1 bonus to the skills and statistics listed with the relevant ability.

FAQ

**Do Temporary Ability Score Increases affect the DCs of monster and PC [supernatural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-) abilities based on those ability scores?**

Although the description of temporarily ability score bonuses just refers to increasing spell DCs, that is a legacy of some older game terminology not being updated as new features were added to the rules. Temporary ability score increases should affect [supernatural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-) ability DCs based on those ability scores, such as a [medusa’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/medusa) [gaze](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-) attack or a [witch’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch) [hexes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch#TOC-Hex).

### Permanent Bonuses

Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics related to that ability. This might cause you to gain skill points, [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points), and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

## Ability Score Damage

Diseases, poisons, spells, and other abilities can all deal damage directly to your ability scores. This damage does not actually reduce an ability, but it does apply a penalty to the skills and statistics that are based on that ability.

For every 2 points of damage you take to a single ability, apply a –1 penalty to skills and statistics listed with the relevant ability. If the amount of [ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage) you have taken equals or exceeds your ability score, you immediately fall [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious) until the damage is less than your ability score. The only exception to this is your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score. If the damage to your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) is equal to or greater than your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score, you die. Unless otherwise noted, damage to your ability scores is healed at the rate of 1 per day to each ability score that has been damaged. Ability damage can be healed through the use of spells, such as [lesser restoration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration#lesser).

**Strength**: Damage to your [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) score causes you to take penalties on [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-)-based skill checks, melee [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll), and weapon damage rolls (if they rely on [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-)). The penalty also applies to your [Combat Maneuver Bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus) (if you are Small or larger) and your [Combat Maneuver Defense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense). A character with a [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) score of 0 is too weak to move in any way and is [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious). Some creatures do not possess a [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) score and have no modifier at all to [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-)-based skills or checks.

**Dexterity**: Damage to your [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) score causes you to take penalties on [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-)-based skill checks, [ranged attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#ranged-attacks) rolls, [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) checks, and [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) saving throws. The penalty also applies to your [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class), your [Combat Maneuver Bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus) (if you are Tiny or smaller), and to your [Combat Maneuver Defense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense). A character with a [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) score of 0 is incapable of moving and is effectively immobile (but not [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious)).

**Constitution**: Damage to your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score causes you to take penalties on your [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) saving throws. In addition, multiply your total [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) by this penalty and subtract that amount from your current and total [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points). Lost [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points) are restored when the damage to your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) is healed. A character with a [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score of 0 is [dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead).

**Intelligence**: Damage to your [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score causes you to take penalties on [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-)-based skill checks. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-). A character with an [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score of 0 is comatose.

**Wisdom**: Damage to your [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-) score causes you to take penalties on [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-)-based skill checks and [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) saving throws. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-). A character with a [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-) score of 0 is incapable of rational thought and is [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious).

**Charisma**: Damage to your [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) score causes you to take penalties on [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)-based skill checks. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based off [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) and the DC to resist your channeled energy. A character with a [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) score of 0 is not able to exert himself in any way and is [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious).

## Ability Score Penalties

Some spells and abilities cause you to take an ability penalty for a limited amount of time. While in effect, these penalties function just like [ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage), but they cannot cause you to fall [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious) or die. In essence, penalties cannot decrease your ability score to less than 1.

## Ability Drain

Ability drain actually reduces the relevant ability score. Modify all skills and statistics related to that ability. This might cause you to lose skill points, [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#hit-points), and other bonuses. Ability drain can be healed through the use of spells such as [restoration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration).
