**Preset Ability Scores**: Instead of assigning the scores, you can use **Table: NPC Ability Scores** to determine the NPC’s ability scores, adjusting them as necessary to fit. Use the Melee NPC ability scores for characters whose primary role involves melee combat, such as [barbarians](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian), [fighters](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter), [monks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk), [paladins](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin), [rangers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger). The Ranged NPC ability scores are for characters that fight with ranged weapons or use their [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) to hit, such as [fighters](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter), [rangers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger), and [rogues](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue). Use the Divine NPC ability scores for characters with divine spellcasting capabilities, such as adepts, [clerics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric), and [druids](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid). The Arcane NPC ability scores should be used by characters with arcane spellcasting capabilities, such as [bards](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard), [sorcerers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer), and [wizards](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard). Finally, the Skill NPC ability scores should be used for characters that focus on skill use, such as aristocrats, [bards](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard), commoners, experts, and [rogues](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue). Some NPCs might not fit into one of these categories and should have custom ability scores.
